    # Hello there! üëã

    So this is my Home Assistant instance üéâ

    This repository exists mostly for my own amusement, but it may contain some things that others might find useful.

    ## Hardware and general setup

    For my setup I use an old Lenovo Yoga Pro 2, it has a touch screen so I have mounted it on the wall by the front door so I can easily access some controls in my Lovelace UI.

    OS | Ubuntu desktop 18.04
    -- | --
    SSD | 512GB
    RAM | 8GB
    Processor | Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i7-4500U Processor
    Connectivity | WiFi

    For the installation method of Home Assistant I went with [the generic Linux installation of Hassio](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/installation/#alternative-install-on-a-generic-linux-host)

    This method stores the files used by hassio/Home Assistant in `/usr/share/hassio`.

    I have mounted a share from my NAS to the `/usr/share/hassio` dir, that way I can handle backups and replication on my NAS.

    For my theme I use [slate](https://github.com/seangreen2/slate_theme) on all my devices for two reasons, it looks good and I can track it in HACS.

    To access my instance I'm using my [Nabu Casa ‚ù§Ô∏è](https://www.nabucasa.com/) link.

    ## custom_components that I use

    A summary of custom_components that I use.

    ### [HACS ‚ù§Ô∏è](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)

    _Manage (Install, track, upgrade) and discover custom elements for Home Assistant._

    I use this to discover new awesome stuff, and to keep the custom elements I use up to date with the latest version of it from the developer.

    ## Custom Lovelace plugins that I use

    A summary of custom Lovelace plugins that I use.

    ### [Compact Custom Header](https://github.com/maykar/compact-custom-header)

    _CCH - Customize the header and add enhancements to Lovelace. Features: kiosk mode, conditional header styling, per user/device views, swiping between views on mobile, and more._

    I use this to get more screen space by minifying the space used by the header, and to lock my laptop that I have in the hallway by the door to one view.

    ### [Favicon Counter](https://github.com/custom-cards/favicon-counter)

    _Show a notification count badge.._

    I use this to show a badge on the Home Assistant tab in my browser when there are active [Persistent notifications](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/persistent_notification/)

    ### [Mini Graph Card](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-graph-card)

    _Minimalistic graph card for Home Assistant Lovelace UI_

    I use this to create beautiful statistics cards for my UI.

    Like all other Home Assistant instances this is also a Work in Progress :D
