# Hello there! 👋

So this is my Home Assistant instance 🎉

This repository exists mostly for my own amusement, but it may contain some things that others might find useful.

## Statistics from the instance

Description | Value
-- | --
{%- set data = namespace(domains=[]) %}
{%- for state in states %}
{%- if state.domain not in data.domains %}
{%- set data.domains = data.domains + [state.domain] %}
{%- endif %}
{%- endfor %}
{%- for domain in data.domains %}
Entities in the [`{{domain}}`](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/{{domain}}) domain | {{states[domain] | count }}
{%- endfor %}
Total state objects | {{ states | count }}

## Hardware and general setup

For my setup I use an old Lenovo Yoga Pro 2, it has a touch screen so I have mounted it on the wall by the front door so I can easily access some controls in my Lovelace UI.

OS | Ubuntu desktop 18.04
-- | --
SSD | 512GB
RAM | 8GB
Processor | Intel® Core™ i7-4500U Processor
Connectivity | WiFi

For the installation method of Home Assistant I went with [the generic Linux installation of Hassio](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/installation/#alternative-install-on-a-generic-linux-host)

This method stores the files used by hassio/Home Assistant in `/usr/share/hassio`.

I have mounted a share from my NAS to the `/usr/share/hassio` dir, that way I can handle backups and replication on my NAS.

To have this work I added this line to my `/etc/fstab` file:

```
192.168.2.123:/volume1/SSD/hassio       /usr/share/hassio       nfs     auto    0       0
```

For my theme I use a [custom version](https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/jvVdXM8sY5/) of [slate](https://github.com/seangreen2/slate_theme) theme modified by [@Villhellm](https://github.com/Villhellm) on all my devices.  


To access my instance I'm using my [Nabu Casa ❤️](https://www.nabucasa.com/) link both internally and externally.

## Custom Lovelace plugins that I use

A summary of custom Lovelace plugins that I use.

### [Compact Custom Header](https://github.com/maykar/compact-custom-header)

_CCH - Customize the header and add enhancements to Lovelace. Features: kiosk mode, conditional header styling, per user/device views, swiping between views on mobile, and more._

I use this to get more screen space by minifying the space used by the header, and to lock my laptop that I have in the hallway by the door to one view.

### [Favicon Counter](https://github.com/custom-cards/favicon-counter)

_Show a notification count badge.._

I use this to show a badge on the Home Assistant tab in my browser when there are active [Persistent notifications](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/persistent_notification/)

### [Mini Graph Card](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-graph-card)

_Minimalistic graph card for Home Assistant Lovelace UI_

I use this to create beautiful statistics cards for my UI.

### [Lovelace Markdown Mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-markdown-mod)

_Makes the built-in [markdown](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/markdown/) card better._

I use this to add functions to the markdown card, like showing states of entities.

***

Like all other Home Assistant instances this is also a Work in Progress :D
